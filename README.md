# Reservia
Web Developer Path Project 2 Reservia

This is my second project on the Web Developer course of Openclassrooms.

The project was to develope the Reservia website, which contains a list of accomodations 
and activites that the users can search for and find available and most popular accomodations
and activites filtered by price, theme and atmosphere in the city of their choice.

I created this website using Visual Studio Code and within HTML and CSS coding language.
The layout of the website were made according to the insturctions of the mockup.
I used Flexbox to position items on the page.

The website conatins:
  -Integrated Font Awesome icons and advised font type.
  -Search input field with search button.
  -Accomodations and activity cards that are clickable empty links.
  -Clickable filters with hover effect.
  -Accommodations and Activities anchor links that leads to certain sections of the page.
  
The website is adapted to desktop mobile and tablet view and compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.
